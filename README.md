to Create a basic Express app that will have a Postgres database I'll need to ensure that I am at root level on terminal
I will start by creating a local repository on terminal.  run mkdir [name] to create a folder and run git init command to make it a repository.
Then I will create a README.md file -- git add . and git commit -m "".
Go to gitHub and create a remote repository that will connect to my local repository
Invite collaborators, Colin, Angie and Jose
Back on terminal and at root level of the repository to create a .gitignore file and an app.js file
run npm init -y to create a package jason without the need to answer set of questions
run npm install express to add it as a dependencies on package jason

then I will open the app.js file and import the express library and since this is a function I will call it
declare a PORT variable and assigne a port number '3000'
create a .env file
MKDIR controllers and create a controllers.js file
